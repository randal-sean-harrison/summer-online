The cards-text-box.html box keeps getting replaced. If the information and codes breaks again, make enter Summer Courses 2020 and upload the cards-text-box.html content into the second text box.

You can't fix the box by copying the extant code, once you've pasted it in. Wordpress is ridiculous and adds all these spaces which makes the (i) disappear. Make sure to get code from the file in this repo and upload to WP each time: cards-text-box.html.
